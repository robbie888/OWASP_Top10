# Portswigger Web Academy Labs

## Summary

In this section I'll be taking the online course by Portswigger.

https://portswigger.net/web-security/Â 

This course was a great over view of the OWASP Top 10 and Burp Suite.

## Links

Here I will list the links to my write-ups for each section, dividing them into sections as per the training material.

- [SQL Injection](SQL%20Injection%20Labs.md)

The rest are coming soon!

## Tools

The tools used throughout this course are all on Kali Linux.

The course focuses on Burp Suite, however I used OWASP ZAP when more practical as noted below.

The Burp Suite Community edition no longer allows for spidering, crawling or auditing of a site, plus the brute force or fuzzing tools are significantly throttled.
